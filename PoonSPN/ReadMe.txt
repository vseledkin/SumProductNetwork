    Sum Product Networks in C++
========================================================================


The puspose of this project is to create a Sum Product Network library in C++ with Cuda. 
This is a personal project. First I will be translating Poon's SPN code from Jave to C++. 
I will strip out MPI from the Java code and replace it with CUDA code. This is mostly to learn how the code works. 
I would then like to build a more generic SPN library.
